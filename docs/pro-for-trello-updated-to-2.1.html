			<h2 class="docs-header center">Optimized loading, performance and stability fixes</h2>
			<p>
				Yes - there were some issues when loading the extension.
				Sometimes cards would dissapear, sometimes the Pro4Trello menu wouldn't appear.
				But that's all in the past. And it all just works so much faster now <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>

			<h2 class="docs-header center">Persistent Group/Project Filters</h2>
			<p>
				When you filter cards by groups/projects - your choice is now saved across your Chrome browsers, just like other board settings.
				There's also a nice indicator when a filter is active.
